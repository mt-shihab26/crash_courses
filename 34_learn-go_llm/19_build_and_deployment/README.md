## üöÄ 19. Build & Deployment in Go

---

### üî® 1. Basic Build Commands

- **`go build`**
  Compiles the packages but does **not** install the binary anywhere. Produces an executable in the current directory (or outputs to a file you specify).

    ```bash
    go build main.go
    # Produces: ./main (executable)
    ```

- **`go run`**
  Compiles and runs the Go program in one step. Good for quick testing, but doesn‚Äôt leave a binary behind.

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

- **`go install`**
  Compiles and installs the binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$GOBIN` directory, making it easy to run from anywhere.

    ```bash
    go install example.com/myapp@latest
    # Then run from anywhere as `myapp`
    ```

### üåê 2. Cross-Compilation

Go makes it easy to compile binaries for other platforms and architectures.

Set two environment variables before running `go build`:

- `GOOS` ‚Äî Target Operating System (e.g., `linux`, `windows`, `darwin` for macOS)
- `GOARCH` ‚Äî Target architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`, `386`, etc.)

**Example: Build for Linux on an AMD64 CPU (from macOS or Windows):**

```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp-linux
```

**Example: Build Windows executable:**

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o myapp.exe
```

### üì¶ 3. Embedding Static Files (Go 1.16+)

Go 1.16 introduced the `embed` package, which lets you **embed files or directories directly into your Go binary** at compile time.

**How to embed:**

```go
package main

import (
	_ "embed"
	"fmt"
)

//go:embed hello.txt
var hello string

func main() {
	fmt.Println(hello)
}
```

- Place `hello.txt` next to your `main.go`.
- When you run or build your program, the contents of `hello.txt` are embedded into the variable `hello`.
- Supports embedding files, directories, and byte slices.
