## What is TypeScript?

-   TypeScript is an open source language and is a superset of JavaScript
-   Offers additional features to JavaScript including static types
-   Using types is completely optional
-   Compiles down to regular JS
-   Can be used for front-end JS as well as backend with Node.js
-   includes most features from ES6, ES7 (class, arrow functions, etc)
-   Types from 3rd party libraries can be added to type definitions

## Dynamic vs Static Typing

-   in dynamically typed languages, the types are associated with run-time value and not named explicitly in your code.
-   in statically typed languages, you explicitly assign types to variables, function parameters, return values, etc
-   Static Examples: Java, C, C++, Rust, Go
-   Dynamic Examples: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP

## Pros & Cons

-   Pros
    -   More Robust
    -   Easily Spot Bugs
    -   Predictability
    -   Readability
    -   Popular
-   Cons
    -   More Code To Write
    -   More To Learn
    -   Required Compilation
    -   Not True Static Types

## Compiling TypeScript

-   TypeScript uses .ts and tsx extensions
-   TSC (TypeScript Compiler) is used to compile .ts files down to .js
-   Can watch files and report error at compile time
-   Many tools include TS compilation by default
-   Most IDEs have great support for TS
-   The tsconfig.json file is used to configure how TypeScript works
