## Notes
* There command data type in python: 'str', 'int', 'float'
* type() function
* Variables: Names that we give to certain values in out programs.
* Assignment: The process of storing a value inside a variable
* Expression: A combination of numbers, symbols, or other variables that produce a result when evaluated.
* Variable Naming Restrictions
    * Don't use keywords or functions that Python reserves for its own.
    * Don't use spaces
    * Must start with a letter or an underscore (_)
    * Must be made up of only letters, numbers and underscores (_)
* Implicit conversion: The interpreter automatically converts one data type into another
* Explicit conversion
* None: A special data type in Python used to indicate that things are empty or that they returned nothing
* Self-documenting code: Written in a way that's readable and does not conceal its intent
* Boolean: One of two possible states: either True or False
* And: To evaluate as true, the **and** operator would need both expressions to be true at the same time.
* Or: if we use the **or** operator, instead, the expression will be true if either of the expressions are true, and false only when both expressions are false.
* Branching: The ability of a program to alter its execution sequence.
